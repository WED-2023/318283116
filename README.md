# A Website Dedicated to Grandma Sara – The One and Only!

## About the Project

This personal website was created as part of a Web Development Environments course assignment at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. It is dedicated to my beloved grandmother – Grandma Sara.

The website was built with love and care to offer her a personal digital space that reflects her life, hobbies, and warm personality. It includes text, images, music, and interactive sections to make it fun and engaging.

## Notes

- This is a **static front-end project** – no back-end or server-side processing is involved.  
- The contact form is **purely visual** and does not send messages.  
- The design uses only vanilla HTML5 and CSS3 (no frameworks or preprocessors).  
- Color palette is based on warm red tones, reflecting emotional and personal values (as taught in the Human-Computer Interaction course).  
- All content is **fully responsive** and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- The Facebook Like button is implemented using the official SDK.  
  > `fb:app_id` was intentionally **omitted** to avoid requiring a Facebook Developer account.  
  > While this may trigger a warning in Facebook's Debugger, it has no effect on actual Like functionality.
